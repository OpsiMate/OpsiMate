## How to Use TV Mode

### 1. **Launch TV Mode**
1. Navigate to your main Dashboard
2. Apply any filters, search terms, or saved views you want to monitor
3. Click the **"TV Mode"** button in the top-right corner
4. TV Mode launches instantly with your current dashboard state

### 2. **Default Configuration**

TV Mode launches with optimized default settings:

#### **Auto Refresh**
- **Enabled by default**: Refreshes every 30 seconds
- **Optimal for monitoring**: Balances real-time updates with performance

#### **View Rotation**
- **Disabled by default**: Stays on your selected view
- **Can be enabled**: Use keyboard shortcuts to cycle views manually

#### **Smart Grid System**
TV Mode automatically calculates the optimal layout based on your service count:

- **1-6 services**: Large cards in up to 3 columns for maximum visibility
- **7-12 services**: Medium cards in 4 columns for balanced view
- **13-24 services**: Small cards in 6 columns for efficient space usage
- **25-48 services**: Small cards in 8 columns for higher density
- **49+ services**: Extra-small cards in 10 columns for maximum capacity

**Automatic Adaptation**: 
- Cards scale down as service count increases
- Less information shown in compact modes (IP addresses, provider details hidden)
- Status badges become single letters in ultra-compact mode
- Alert counts always remain visible

#### **Saved View Integration**
- **Inherits your dashboard state**: Filters, search terms, and column settings
- **No configuration needed**: Just set up your view in the dashboard first
- **URL bookmarking**: Share specific TV Mode configurations via URL

## Service Card Information

Each service card displays:

## Best Practices

### **For NOC/Operations Centers**
1. **Use large displays** (32" or larger) for best visibility
2. **Set auto-refresh** to 30-60 seconds
3. **Enable view rotation** to cycle through different perspectives
4. **Position displays** at eye level for operators
5. **Use high contrast themes** for better visibility

### **For Team Monitoring**
1. **Configure shorter refresh intervals** (15-30 seconds) for active monitoring
2. **Focus on error view** during incident response
3. **Use running view** for general health monitoring
4. **Adjust grid columns** based on number of services

### **For Wall Mounts**
1. **Use 4K displays** for maximum information density
2. **Set longer rotation intervals** (90-120 seconds) for readability
3. **Ensure proper lighting** to avoid screen glare
4. **Test visibility** from typical viewing distances
