# Cursor Code Style Rule

Always design for split subcomponents and strong separation of concerns.

1. Subcomponents & Hooks:
   - If logic/UI grows, split into subcomponents or hooks.
   - Each component/hook lives in its own file.
   - File name matches export name exactly.
   - Props interface stays in the same file above the definition.

2. Utils:
   - Stateless pure helper functions go to `${componentName}.utils.ts`.

3. Constants:
   - No hardcoded strings or magic numbers.
   - Put them in `${componentName}.constants.ts` and export/import.

4. Types:
   - No anonymous inline object types.
   - Use interfaces only.
   - Extract shared/non-props interfaces to `${componentName}.types.ts`.
   - Props interfaces remain in the component/hook file.
